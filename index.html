            As a freelancer, I rely on 3rd party payment service providers, like Toptal Payments, and Payoneer to access
            my earning. Such services usually have a fee for each transaction.
        </p>

        <p class="font-serif w-1/2 m-auto text-lg mt-2 leading-relaxed">
            Everytime I go to withdraw money from the debit card provided by these services, I have to first pull out a
            calculator and figure out how much I can withdraw, given the amount of money in my card. This utility web app
            is built to replace that friction point.
